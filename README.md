# Awesome Leetcode
A few methods/strategies I gathered for cracking those leetcode problems

* Fast and Slow pointers  
Good for: minimum substring/window problems  
> [209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)  
> [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring)

* Decreasing/Increasing stack  
Maintain a ordered stack
> [853. Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/)

* Decreasing/Increasing sequence  
Sometimes, ordered sequence provides key info to solving the problem  
> [556. Next Greater Element III](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-iii/)  

* Pruning  
Sometimes brutal force is the only obvious way, but by pruning impossible cases and breaking early we can make the solution fast enough to be accepted.  
> [18. 4Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/)
