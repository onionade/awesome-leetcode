# Awesome Leetcode
A few methods/strategies I gathered for cracking those leetcode problems

1 Fast and Slow pointers
> Good for: minimum substring/window problems  
> [209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)  
> 

2 Decreasing/Increasing sequence
> Ordered sequence can be the key to solving the problem  
> [556. Next Greater Element III](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-iii/)  


3 Pruning
> Sometimes brutal force is the only obvious way, but by pruning impossible cases and breaking early we can make the solution fast enough to be accepted.  
> [18. 4Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/)
